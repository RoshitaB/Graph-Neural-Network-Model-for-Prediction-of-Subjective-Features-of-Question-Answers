### Overview
- NLU is crucial for applications like chatbots and sentiment analysis.
- Our solution focuses on equitable visibility of valuable responses in online question-answering platforms.

### Dataset
The Google Quest Q&A Labelling Dataset has been used in the proposed work to construct a predictive model using
GNN that can predict the subjective aspects of question-and-answer pairs.

### Methodology
- Utilizes SAGE Conv Graph Neural Network with SAGEConv operator for feature extraction.
- Evaluates question-answer quality comprehensively by incorporating nuanced subjective labels from the Google Quest dataset.
- Bridges the gap between human comprehension and machine analysis.

### Advantages of GNNs
- GNNs capitalize on inherent graph structures within text.
- Addresses intricate language subtleties, enhancing precision compared to traditional NLP techniques.

### Experimental Results
- Conducted on Google Quest Dataset.
- Impressive R2 score of 0.644 and exceptionally low MSE score of 0.00050.

### Conclusion
- Paves the way for enhanced NLU accuracy in diverse applications.
